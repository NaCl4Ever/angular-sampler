# Resume

This is a resume project, you want to see what I know, so here it is. 

## Run Locally

Do an `ng serve` magically you'll have my app running on your machine, if it doesn't work on the first go make sure you run `npm install` or `yarn`. ðŸ‘Œ

## Why does this exist?

I wanted to do something different for a project, I kept getting stuck on what to build. Finally after drinking a 2-liter of Mountain Dew I decided to just make a project that could display resume worthy skills. Here you have a tour of what I consider reasonable skillsets to have when doing Angular + Typescript Development.
