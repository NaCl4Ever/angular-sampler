  <h2 class = "subtitle is-1 has-text-centered"> What is this for?</h2>
  <p class = "has-text-centered">To be quite honest this is just my way of toying around in Angular and making a simple demo out of each concept.
    <br> It saves you time to see features clearly labelled and showing what to look for, as opposed to digging for that one promise in a service call.
  </p>
  <h2 class = "subtitle is-1 has-text-centered"> Why isn't this pretty?</h2>
  <p class = "has-text-centered">Currently I'm only doing modest styling, otherwise I'll never complete anything here. As I get time I'll try and add images + styling.

        My formatting for most of my site will be as follows a simple little area to display some facet of my Angular
        knowledge whether basic or not as basic. This is a simple click handler, qualifiying me for most junior development positions, and half of all management
        positions.
